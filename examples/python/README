Instructions
------------

1. Make sure that you have successfully built CRATES and that you have 'sourced'
   the devel environment. i.e. 'source /path/to/crates/devel/setup.bash'
2. Switch to a second terminal and run the CRATES simulator
   > roslaunch sim sw.launch
4. Return to your original terminal and run the example
   > python example.py

The code will pause the simulation, insert a quadrotor and run the simulator.
The position of the quadrotor will be published at 1Hz to the console.
