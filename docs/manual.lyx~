 framework.
 This framework provides an environment for efficiently prototyping application-
level controllers for multi-platform robotic experiments, by improving the
 process by which simulations are translated to hardware experiments.
 This is achieved by nesting simulated and actual platform code within a
 single framework.
 Both implementations inherit common, core functionality from a hardware
 abstraction layer (HAL).
 The HAL exposes the underlying device -- be it simulated or actual hardware
 -- as a generic class of robot that can be interacted with over a messaging
 infrastructure.
 This loose coupling allows the complexity of the underlying platform to
 be hidden from the cognitive controller, keeping the research focus on
 the design of the application-level controller rather than low-level implementa
tion details.
 The framework makes use of the open source Robotics Operating System (ROS)
 and Gazebo simulator, both of which have received significant commercial
 and community support over the last few years.
 Although we envision it having a broader impact in the robotics community,
 in the first instance the framework is geared towards controlling swarms
 of quadrotors.
 It is therefore distributed with a quadrotor HAL and drivers for the Ascending
 Technologies flight control system.
 In addition, the distribution includes simulator plugins for environmental
 conditions (meteorological, wind turbulence, satellite vehicle orbits)
 and sensors (inertial, magnetic, barometric altitude, satellite navigation
 receiver).
 The contribution being a complete toolkit for high-fidelity, outdoor, multi-pla
tform quadrotor simulation and experimentation.
 By releasing this framework to the robotics community as an open source
 project, we hope that others will share in our vision and contribute to
 the project.
 The ultimate goal being to develop a rich tool set, which lowers the barrier
 to running application-level algorithms on multi-robot systems.

Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This document describes a robotics framework that emerged within the EU-funded
 CompLACS research project as a means for transferring machine learning
 theory to practical hardware experiments.
 The quadrotor platform is one of three experimental platforms, and we encourage
 the reader to visit complacs.org for more information about the other two
 platforms.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Quadrotor experiments are particularly challenging, as there are significant
 safety, cost and practical considerations that must be taken into account.
 These challenges were identified early in the project, and the decision
 was made to develop a high-fidelity quadrotor simulation framework in which
 to prototype machine learning algorithms.
 By the end of the second year of the project a Matlab simulator had been
 developed, along with four key scenarios.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It was realized that significant work would still need to be taken to transfer
 the resulting application code from simulation to the experimental platforms.
 This, along with other subtle architectural and performance issues, provided
 a motivation to shift to a new architecture.
 The revised framework was built upon the Robotic Operating System (ROS)
 and Gazebo simulator, and makes use of a hardware abstraction layer to
 decouple the high-level application code from the underlying device, be
 it a simulated or real entity.
 A decision was made to disseminate the framework as an open source project,
 with the aim of lowering the barrier to entry for outdoor, multi-platform
 robotic experiments.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The objective of this document is to provide an accessible description of
 the framework as it currently stands.
 It is strongly advised that Chapter 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 be read in entirety, as it contains fundamental information about the framework.
 Chapter 2 is targeted primarily at users of the simulator, and covers basic
 installation, the common tools that it offers and typical usage patterns.
 Chapter 3 is geared towards those who wish to extend the simulator by adding
 new components.
 Chapter 4 contains the technical about the current components offered in
 the simulator, considered too detailed for earlier chapters.

\begin_layout Standard
The architecture of

 is motivated by the layered control that emerges naturally in multi-robot
 problems.
 Consider the follow three levels at which a robotic platform may be controlled:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

Application-level

 - The control process that transforms general application-level goals,
 such as

\end_inset

, into platform motion goals, such as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

UAV0 move to waypoint X
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 This type of control can be issued from a base station (remotely operated)
 or a navigation co-processor (autonomous) at a low rate (5Hz) with high
 delay tolerance.

 into a hardware-level goal, such as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Roll=A, Pitch=B, Yaw=C, Throttle=D
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Typically, this control is implemented in a co-processor on board the quadrotor

 - The process that transforms flight-level control instructions, such as

The key things to note is that, while the platform and hardware level control
 needs to be tightly coupled, the application and platform level control
 need not be.

 exposes platform-level control to the application-level though a hardware
 abstraction layer (HAL).
 This is reflective of an object-oriented paradigm, where the HAL can be
 thought of as a platform type, such as a

, which is inherited by specific flight controller.
 The benefit of this abstraction is that it masks whether the entity itself
 is simulated or actual hardware,

\begin_layout Section
Conventions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is impossible to discuss the system without first specifying the units
 and coordinate frame conventions that are used.
 Importantly, some of these conventions are different from those that are
 typically used in aviation.We have adopted the conventions used in the Gazebo
 simulator, which are extensions to those typically used in 3D modelling.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Units
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For consistency, The entire framework adopts SI conventions in order to
 be as.
 Distance is measured in meters and angles are measured in radians.
 Temperature, pressure and relative humidity are measured in degrees Kelvin,
 millibars and percentages respectively.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Coordinate frames
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For modelling convenience we have chosen to represent the quadrotor as a
 rigid body with six degrees of freedom in three dimensional space.
 Describing its motion requires a minimum of two coordinate frames -- a
 body frame and navigation frame.
 The underlying reason for this is that rotation can only be described as
 the orientation of one frame with respect to another.
 Where integration with a GNSS system is required, a third navigation frame
 is used.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Body frame
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is a right-hand, cartesian coordinate frame that is fixed with respect
 to the rigid body of the quadrotor.
 The origin of this coordinate frame is illustrated by red, green and blue
 arrows, which correspond to X, Y and Z.
 Since they are obtained from a strapdown navigation system, inertial and
 magnetic measurements are obtained in this coordinate frame.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Navigation frame
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Similar to the body frame, the navigation frame is described by a right-hand
 cartesian coordinate system.
 The key difference is that the origin is described by a fixed point on
 the earth's surface, with +X corresponding to East, +Y to North and +Z
 upwards toward the sky.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Resolving frame
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order for a quadrotor to close the loop of its position controller, it
 requires absolute measurements of its position.
 Indoor quadrotor experiments typically use motion capture systems to achieve
 position updates with millimeter accuracy within the navigation frame.
 However, outdoors one must rely on navigation solutions from a Global navigatio
n satellite system (GNSS) such as GPS.
 Since these systems operate on a global scale, a spherical coordinate is
 needed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Inside a GNSS receiver a position solution is first obtained in a geocentric,
 cartesian coordinate frame.
 The origin of this coordinate system is the centre of the earth, with its
 axes defined by the equator, Greenwich meridian and north-south polar line.
 Importantly, this coordinate frame is fixed with respect to the earth.
 Since the satellite vehicles are not geosynchronous (orbital peiod of 12
 hours) they have a position that changes with time.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The GNSS receiver ultimately projects its internal geocentric solution into
 a geodetic, spherical coordinate frame, where position is described by
 a latitude, longitude and altitude.
 Importantly, altitude is described relative to sea-level and not the centre
 of the earth.
 The WGS84 model provides a standard definition of the centre of the earth
 and its sea level, allowing GNSS receivers to obtain consistent projections
 between geocentric and geodetic coordinate frames.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Rotations
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Quadrotors are rotationally symmetric, and hence there is ambiguity as to
 which is the forward direction of motion.
 In our system an orange band is used to represent the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

forward
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 direction of motion.
 With this information one can easily see that Fig X graphically depicts
 a rotational alignment of the body and navigation frames.
 We define 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

roll
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

pitch
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

yaw
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 as Euler rotations about the X, Y and Z body-frame axes respectively.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One of the drawbacks of describing rotations by Euler angles is that it
 introduces rotational ambiguity: the order in which the angles are applied
 matters.
 Although superior representation exist, they are less intuitive to work
 with.
 Rather than project a representation on users of the system, we have chosen
 to adopt a X-Y-Z angle application ordering.

Challenges

\begin_layout Subsection
Time synchronisation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The ROS / Gazebo toolchain resolves this issue by binding the ROS system
 clock to the simulated time published by Gazebo.
 The advantage that this brings is that any timers in the ROS environment
 behave according to simulated time.
 It is strongly suggested that users of the framework take this into considerati
on when writing application-level controller code, and avoid using timers
 bound to a different clock.

 would not be possible without the contributions from many individuals inside
 and outside the CompLACS project.
 In particular, Renzo De Nardi developed the Matlab simulator, which included
 environment models, quadrotor dynamics and sensor models.
 Along the way significant contributions were made by Stephen Hailes, Simon
 Julier and Luke Teacy.

Quadrotors
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Quadrotors have proven themselves as favourable flight platforms for UAV
 research, since they are inexpensive, agile and relatively safe to operate.
 Four propellers are located on the corners of a square, and generate downward
 thrust along the body of the platform.
 However, two of these propellers counter-rotate in order to balance torque.
 If the power to all of the motors is increased or decreased, then the platform'
s altitude increases or decreases respectively.
 Heading is controlled by evenly-shifting a proportion of the force from
 one pair of opposing motors to the other pair.
 Pitch and roll are controlled by shifting the relative force of opposing
 motors.
 This action also changes the thrust direction, causing the quadrotor to
 translate by an amount related to the tilt angle.
