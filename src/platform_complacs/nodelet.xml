    <description> 
		The objective of the FlightControlSystem class is to interface with the flight control system (FCS) provided by Ascending Technologies (AscTec). The class instantiates a single asynchronous serial class, which binds to port /dev/ttyUSB0 at 57600 baud to interface with the High Level (HL) controller on the FCS. The communication protocol used is the AscTec Control Interface (ACI) and the HL is flashed with the stock firmware (V3). This firmware provides the ability to do three major things â€“ requets variables, control commands and set parameters.

    <description> 
		This is an abstraction away from an IEEE 802.11 adapter. In the background each UAV runs Optimized Links State Routing (OLSR) to discover and associate with peers, as they connect and disconnect. This class sits on top of this layer, and continually scans for peers in communication range. When a peer platform is discovered this nodelet registers its own /hal/xxx on the foreign platform, which allows the foreign platform to access local messages, services and actions.
