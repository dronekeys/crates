SCHEDULE 3 - The Information
1.NAME
LIDAR Composite (November 2013)
 
i. Description:
Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) is an airborne mapping technique, which uses a laser to measure the distance between the aircraft and the ground.  Up to 100,000 measurements per second are made of the ground, allowing highly detailed terrain models to be generated at spatial resolutions of between 25cm and 2 metres. The Environment Agency's LIDAR data archive contains digital elevation data derived from surveys carried out since 1998.
 
LIDAR composite data is available in ASCII and JPEG format. The ASCII format data is derived from a combination of all of our data which has been merged and re-sampled to give the best possible coverage. The Digital Surface Models include heights of objects, such as vehicles, buildings and vegetation, as well as the terrain surface. The Digital Terrain Model (DTM) is produced by removing objects from the Digital Surface Model. The JPEG format is a geo-referenced, shaded relief image only, which is colour coded for elevation.

ii. Format:
The data (ESRI ASCII GRID format)
TL2303_DSM_1M,TL2302_DSM_1M,TL2303_DTM_1M,TL2302_DTM_1M


iii. Is it a set of documents such as technical reports: No
