The files in this directory are meant to help speed up the install process. The GPSTK source installs to $prefix/include by default, thereby polluting the OS file structure. A small modification was made to the CMakeLists.txt to put hte source into the $prefix/include/gpstk folder in stead. In addition, support for uninstallation was added, as well as the option to avoid building the examples. Otherwise, the source remains as distributed in Version 2.4.
